# Building

You will need Clang/GCC, Ninja, and Lua (Luajit works)

For the most part doing `lua build.lua` will build the CLI app, if you wish to build
the library by itself add `-cuik` and/or `-tb` depending on what is wanted. If you wish
for a shared object (DLL/SO) add `-shared` which by default will compile with Cuik and TB.
