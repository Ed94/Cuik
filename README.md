lmao unfinished

The plan is a modern C compiler which can mostly work with Clang, GCC, and MSVC while also introducing some new ideas.

If you're wondering about the tinybackend static library, it's essentially a project of mine that's not ready for everyone's precious eyes so i've been sharing it just enough to actually let people play with the compiler but not play with the backend (it'll be open source eventually).

It should work on an x64 Windows or Linux platform, i'll get around to other platforms later and there's still issues with the Linux build especially with the ABI and how it plays with the backend.
