I'm going to be on a diagnostics improvement grind so i wanna write down some stuff i need to get in:
	Struct field shadowing (a field in a struct matches another one, sometimes this fails because of it being inside of an unnamed struct)


Enum values aren't being resolved by the new parser, fix that, they all turn out as 0
